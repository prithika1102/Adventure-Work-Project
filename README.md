About This Project: 

Passion for data analysis inspired me to explore data engineering, focusing on building scalable pipelines, transformations, and cloud-based storage solutions.

This project uses the AdventureWorks dataset to demonstrate data integration using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Databricks. It showcases:

🔄 Dynamic pipelines using ForEach activities

📜 Parameterization with JSON scripts for source-to-destination mapping

🔗 Linked Services to securely connect to data sources and destinations

🗄️ Data extraction and loading into Azure Data Lake Gen2

💾 Basic data transformations in Databricks and storing processed data in the Silver layer

    -- > Basic transformations:

    o Created full names for customers by concatenating first, last, and prefix

    o Split email addresses to extract domains

    o Cleaned and formatted product and sales data

    o Stored transformed datasets into Silver layer in Parquet format

💾 External table data storing in Azue synapse analytics for further analytical process and visualization using Power BI.
