About This Project: 

Passion for data analysis inspired me to explore data engineering, focusing on building scalable pipelines and cloud-based storage solutions.

This project uses the AdventureWorks dataset to demonstrate data integration using Azure Data Factory (ADF). 

It showcases: 

🔄 Dynamic pipelines using ForEach activities

📜 Parameterization with JSON scripts for source-to-destination mapping

🔗 Use of Linked Services to securely connect to data sources and destinations

🗄️ Data extraction and loading into Azure Data Lake Gen2
